# smartapisync
Project not commited yet; build in progress This library is an NPM package designed to be integrated in any front end type-script-based application; the goal is to allow the developers to create their own sync methods and by having this module, the application can work in an offline mode, when back online the module can handle the calls to the api to sync the data and store the actions made while offline.

Meant to be responsive, works well on mobile and PC, recent navigator version may be required (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
